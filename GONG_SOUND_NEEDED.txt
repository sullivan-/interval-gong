IMPORTANT: You need to add a gong sound file!

Please add a file named "gong.mp3" to this directory before deploying.

Where to get a gong sound:
1. Visit https://freesound.org/ and search for "gong"
2. Filter by Creative Commons 0 license for unrestricted use
3. Download a gong sound that is at least 3 seconds long
4. Convert to MP3 format if necessary
5. Rename it to "gong.mp3"
6. Place it in this root directory

The app will not work without this file!
